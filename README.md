## 🧩 Implementation Details
1.**Search and Filtering**<br>
*SearchBar Component*: Allows users to search articles by entering keywords. This triggers a search request to the selected data sources.<br>
*FilterOptions Component*: Users can filter articles based on categories, date ranges, and sources. This component interacts with Redux to update the filter criteria.<br>
2.**Personalized News Feed**<br>
*PersonalizedFeed Component*: Displays a custom news feed based on user preferences such as preferred categories, sources, and authors. User preferences are stored in Redux and used to fetch and display relevant articles.<br>
3.**Mobile-Responsive Design**<br>
*Responsive Layout*: The UI components are designed using React Bootstrap, ensuring the layout adjusts for different screen sizes. Media queries are used for custom styling on mobile devices.<br>
4.**API Integration**
api.js contains four different data sources newsAPI, guardianAPI, nytAPI, and gnewsAPI: These service file handle API requests to the respective data sources. It contains functions to fetch data, and convert all the data into normalize data which are used in Redux actions and components.

5.**Redux Toolkit**: Used to manage the state of the application, including articles fetched, user preferences, and filter criteria. Redux slices (articlesSlice.js) are created to handle specific aspects of the state.
